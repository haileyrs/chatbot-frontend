# About

This is the frontend for a Generative AI chatbot prototype. The project was used to demonstrate AI capabilities and inspired the creation of an internal tool for a client. 
This specific branch is connected to a fake api, but the original version made calls to a RAG architecture that existed in AWS. To see the app demo in action, follow the steps below. 


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
